Two available topics:

1. Neural network on call option prices:
	We first simulate the data through BSM and train the data with the neural network. Finally apply the network to the real data.

2. Classification on direction of the stock prices
	Simulate and train them with classification network.

1. We settled on the first topic.
2. Neural network training is being tested->Back_Propagation
3. Need to add 30 days historical volatility as inputs to be simulated->simulation
4. Need to add activation functions library->NeuronLayer_V0
5. Exceptional handling for all the modules
